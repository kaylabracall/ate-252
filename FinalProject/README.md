## Capstone Inquiry
This project aims to look at fatality among older drivers, specifically those ages 65 and older. Are older drivers more likely to be involved in a fatal accident? Are drivers 75 and older more likely to be involved in a fatal accident than those aged 65 to 74? What are the most fatal driving conditions for older drivers?

## Data Cleaning
